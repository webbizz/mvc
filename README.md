### Model, View, Controller.., <b>Simplified!</b>
Experiments using the Model, View, Controller method.
## Why?
Understand that I am a *self-taught* developer so it can be
almost certain that parts of the following remarks and claims
will be those made by a *newbie* and filled with ignorance!

## Installation
I'll start by saying that I have spent many hours cloning, forking and or
downloading various applications from the pages of GitHub.
All of which were once extracted, folders filled with more folders and files
that left me dumbfounded as to what to do next in order to actually USE
whatever application it happened to be!

Though many were understandably in this condition so as to meet
the various dependancy requirements, there were those that added to
my already confused state of being because there really was no clear
and justifiable reason for such a bloated file!  No dependancies or 
very minimal requirements.  It was almost like the creator or creators had
stuffed the folders full simply to say, 
<blockquote>
  "ohhhh, look at all these files! We must
be really smart, technically gifted geniuses!"
  </blockquote>
  
 The point is, there was simply no reason for it! So I most likely
 missed out on what may have been something that I would have enjoyed
 using and or contributing to!
 
 There is something to be said for learning a new language like *node.js*
 and how to work with it via *npm*. However, if it's just not neccessasary,
 why complicate things?  Which brings me around to the installation of, MVCS!
 
 Should you happen to take an interest in my experiments here, the only requirement
 that must be satisfied is an installation of a *Web server* such as *Apache, Nginx*
 or something similar in order to enable viewing the files contained in this repo as
 they are for the most part written in PHP.  Additionally, a bit of knowledge in PHP
 will surely help to avoid any hair loss because as things are currently, you will
 need to edit <a href="https://github.com/webbizz/mvc/blob/master/webbizz/core/Webbizz.class.php">Webbizz.class.php</a>
 so that it sets globals to correctly point to the applications other files.
 eg.., *define the directory root as the start of your path variables*.  Regarding *paths*,
 I suggest that you leave the applications file structure intact to avoid complicating
 things. ...
